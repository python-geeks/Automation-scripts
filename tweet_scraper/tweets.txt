Learned how to treat the logistic regression algorithm as a neural network, and honestly, the maths was so satisfying.

@battbot_ can take simulation requests now! I'm just hoping that the Heroku deployment won't break 🥲 https://t.co/UN1uUmXq4T
===============================================================
@shivambzt @gsoc @pybamm_ @robertwtimms @tinosulzer @brosaplanella Sure @shivambzt! It would be tough to debug it here but I'll try, or if you think there is an issue/bug with the installation, you can create a new issue/discussion here - https://t.co/gdq9IhH1lI
===============================================================
Vacationing after 3 years!

Second and the last week of "no-code".

I spent the last week studying maths (linear algebra and multivariable calculus), but I realised, I was still using my laptop 24x7.

This week no laptop, and no code. 

I'll probably explore all the beaches 🤩 https://t.co/s8XXYbqgAX
===============================================================
Also, the final project (the bot) is available here - @battbot_ 🔋
===============================================================
@gsoc is finally over, and the summer went beyond my expectations🤖.
I'll be working with @pybamm_ more, but after a short break🌴.
Finally, a special thanks to my mentors, couldn't have done this without them - @robertwtimms, @tinosulzer, @brosaplanella😄

@KHaghverdi Hi! I’m probably not the best person to answer them, but I’ll be happy to help if I can:)
===============================================================
@gsoc @pybamm_ Also, thanks to the pandemic, my next semester will be starting from 16th (online again) 🥲
===============================================================
The last couple of weeks were very hectic but my freshman year is finally over! Also, I know I am late but the blog covering weeks 7 and 8 of @gsoc, working for @pybamm_, is up here - https://t.co/c1pRsnCL2S
===============================================================
RT @brosaplanella: Sounds about right...

===============================================================
@bcjanmay @robertwtimms @battbot_ @pybamm_ The bot, right now, is not tweeting any GIF with degradation mechanisms "on", as they are under active development. My account on the other hand is a testing area for these tweets so you might see some weird GIFs in the future too😅
===============================================================
Week 5 and 6 blog, covering the process of making the bot completely independent, is up! Also, check out @battbot_ for some fun tweets🔋🤖

https://t.co/UnR6Q22mfr
===============================================================
The official bot is live🥳🔋 https://t.co/dqffXXpTxv
===============================================================
@bcjanmay Constant discharge (I hope I am not wrong, new to battery science), no idea about the step shaped plot😅, maybe @pybamm_ can help with that
===============================================================
Plotting Single Particle Model with Chen2020 parameters and reaction limited SEI, for experiment: [('Discharge at 3 C until 3.3 V', 'Charge at 3 C until 3.8 V', 'Hold at 3.8 V until 63 mA')] https://t.co/tTK5SgeRhE
===============================================================
It’s always so exciting to read about the groundbreaking discoveries in science, and using Open Source Softwares make them even more exciting!

My favourite one will be the Nobel Prize use case (always been a fan of Physics, Astrophysics and Space).

Also, @pybamm_ is there😄🥳 https://t.co/nAUoODagtG
===============================================================
My third blog, covering weeks 3 and 4 of the coding period of @gsoc (while working on the @pybamm_ bot) is up on my medium account, explore it here -

It took me some time, but I finally built python 3.8.6 from the source on my Windows Subsystem for Linux, adding all the missing modules after the installation and reconfiguring everything at the end.

Being new to Linux, I suddenly feel powerful.

Around this time, back in 2020, I was capturing the solar eclipse using my telescope and mobile, and though the setup was quite unstable, I did manage to get some good photos and I remember how excited I was☀️

Also, I really need a camera📷 and a camera mount for my telescope🔭 https://t.co/onZIzAS8Ws
