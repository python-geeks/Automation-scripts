Generate an App Password:

    1. Go to Google Account Security Settings.
    
    2. Under "Signing in to Google," find App passwords and create one for this script (youâ€™ll need to have 2-step verification enabled on your account).

    3. Use this app password in the script instead of your Gmail account password.
