Learning is one of the overcommunicated but underleveraged tools of the common entrepreneur.  Everyone talks about methods of learning, but few people find realistic and authentic techniques that actually yield a net profit in the information and application categories.  Elon Musk has broken through that barrier with learning techniques that have proven successful not just once, but time and time again.  A good argument could be made that Musk has leveraged his learning by becoming a disruptor. He and his companies have shifted entire industries, including the transportation sector, the energy sector, and the space sector.  He recently announced at a press conference that his plans for his biotech company Neuralink are progressing quite nicely, hinting at yet another sector which his hands will likely shift in the coming years.  Yes, Musk is a once-in-a-lifetime genius. Likely on the same levels as Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton. He has a different way of viewing problems than the average entrepreneur.
