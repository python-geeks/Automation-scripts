## Crypto Currency

- This is a python script which needs the libraries mentioned in requirements file.
- This script is used to fetch the data from the website and store it in a csv file.
- We need a web browser for this to run. Here, I am using chrome browser. I have downloaded the chrome web driver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html. Note: download the driver according to the version of chrome you are using.
- The script is run in a loop. It will run for a period of time.
- After the execution, you can find the csv file in the same directory.
- The file coins.csv contains the basic data of top 100 coins.
- The file coin_data_[datetime].csv contains the full data of the particular coin, which you gave as input.
