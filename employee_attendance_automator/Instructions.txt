If you are on windows with anaconda it is easy for you to install all the packages.
if yo are on linux make sure you have made aliases for python=python3 and pip=pip3 etc . Follow online guides to do that (do not skip this)
Install packages in the same order.

The packages are as follows:

git clone https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/TensorFlow-2-Lite-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi.git
